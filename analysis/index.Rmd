Welcome. 

## Objectives

- Participants learn about the usage of empirically-parameterized simulations for decision making about optimal breeding schemes.
- Generate recommendations to NGC and stakeholders regarding key breeding scheme-related questions.

[Creating this workflowR page for the group](workflowr_workflow.html)

[AlphaSimHlpR first steps](AlphaSimHlpR_firstSteps.html): Installation and quickly running the `AlphaSimHlpR` tutorial example.

[Reducing error with new tools](example-simulation-reducing-error-with-new-tools.html): Run a simple example simulation of the effect of reducing error with new tools. The first part, which currently is where my progress terminated, was to try and initiate a simulation and burn-in under phenotypic selection for several cycles before switching to genomic selection. **Spoiler alert:** Still needs work.
