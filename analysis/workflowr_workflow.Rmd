Below, I document the process of creating and publishing a `workflowr` documentation for the Breeding Scheme Opt. Group.

To implement yourself, also recommend you check out the [getting started page](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-01-getting-started.html) for `workflowr`.

I work in Rstudio. I use the Rstudio GUI to create the project and do a few other tasks that don't need automation.

`File > New Project > New Directory > Create workflowr project`

![](data/images/Pasted%20image%2020210422123729.png)

Enter your Git / GitHub user name and email address to facilitate version control set-up.

The project get's set up automatically.

Get presented with initial files and file structure.

File in a super brief description or other relevant information in the `README.md`; this will appear on the main GitHub repository for the project.

Next `index.Rmd`. This is the home / landing page for the project. Combined with the top navigation bar (which is edited in the `_site.yml`).

Change the theme and syntax highlighting in `_site.yml` to **yeti** and **breezedark** because I like them.

From here, content creation begins.

I add new Rmd's in the `analysis/` directory as I go. I *also* subsequently link new documents in the `index.Rmd` main page and on the navbar (`_site.yml`) as desired.

Once the structure is in place, it's pretty straightforward to build on.

You can add and automatically open a new Rmd using

```{r}
workflowr::wflow_open("analysis/AlphaSimHlpR_firstSteps.Rmd")
```

Automatically adds a bit of `yaml` at the top to connect it to the rest of the project. Customize the title, author name, etc as desired.

```{yaml}

```

Now I'm ready to do an initial "publish" of the project, which means the `*.Rmd` files will be compiled into `*.html` in the `docs/` directory. Also a Git commit will occur.

I like to manually record each Rmd I publish for precision, but you can compile *everything* if you want.

```{r}
workflowr::wflow_publish(c("analysis/AlphaSimHlpR_firstSteps.Rmd",
                           "analysis/example-simulation-reducing-error-with-new-tools.Rmd",
                           "analysis/index.Rmd", 
                           "analysis/about.Rmd", 
                           "analysis/license.Rmd",
                           "analysis/_site.yml"),
                         "Publish the initial files for the Breeding Scheme Optimization Group project")
```

```{r}
workflowr::wflow_use_github(username="wolfemd", create_on_github = T)
workflowr::wflow_git_push(usename="wolfemd")
```

Now the repository is uploaded to GitHub.

Last step to make it live on GitHub Pages

In GitHub repository --\> "Settings" (approx top right")

![](data/images/Pasted%20image%2020210422135034.png)

Choose Pages (left side bar) --\> Choose Source branch "master" and directory /docs

![](data/images/Pasted%20image%2020210422135018.png)

Site is now published to: <https://wolfemd.github.io/BreedingSchemeOptGroup/>

Might take a few moments to be live.

Last step, add *this* page to the workflowR project.

``` {r}
workflowr::wflow_open("analysis/workflowr_workflow.Rmd")
```

```{r}
workflowr::wflow_publish(c("analysis/index.Rmd", 
                           "analysis/_site.yml",
                           "analysis/workflowr_workflow.Rmd"),
                         republish = T, # republish=T since we updated _site.yml
                         message = "Publish the workflowr workflow itself.")
```
